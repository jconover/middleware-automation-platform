# ShellCheck configuration for middleware-automation-platform

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# Reason: ShellCheck cannot follow dynamic source paths or files outside the repository
# (e.g., /etc/profile, ~/.bashrc, sourced scripts with variable paths)
# This is expected in deployment scripts that source environment-specific configs.
