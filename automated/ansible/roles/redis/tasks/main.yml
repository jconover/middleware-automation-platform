# This role is intentionally a stub/no-op.
# In AWS deployments, we use managed services:
# - ElastiCache for Redis
#
# This role exists for:
# 1. Documentation of the component's purpose
# 2. Future on-premises deployments
# 3. Local development environments
#
# To enable, set the appropriate variable:
#   redis_managed: false  (for self-hosted Redis)
